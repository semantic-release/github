## Configuration

### GitHub authentication

[environment variables](#environment-variables).

Follow the [Creating a personal access token for the command line](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line) documentation to obtain an authentication token. The token has to be made available in your CI environment via the `GH_TOKEN` environment variable. The user associated with the token must have push permission to the repository.

##### proxy examples

#### assets

Can be a [glob](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob#glob-primer) or and `Array` of
[globs](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob#glob-primer) and `Object`s with the following properties:

| Property | Description                                                                                              | Default                              |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `path`   | **Required.** A [glob](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob#glob-primer) to identify the files to upload. | -                                    |
| `name`   | The name of the downloadable file on the GitHub release.                                                 | File name extracted from the `path`. |

Each entry in the `assets` `Array` is globbed individually. A [glob](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob#glob-primer)
can be a `String` (`"dist/**/*.js"` or `"dist/mylib.js"`) or an `Array` of `String`s that will be globbed together
(`["dist/**", "!**/*.css"]`).

If a directory is configured, all the files under this directory and its children will be included.

**Note**: If a file has a match in `assets` it will be included even if it also has a match in `.gitignore`.

##### assets examples

`'dist/*.js'`: include all the `js` files in the `dist` directory, but not in its sub-directories.

`[['dist', '!**/*.css']]`: include all the files in the `dist` directory and its sub-directories excluding the `css`
files.

`[{path: 'dist/MyLibrary.js', label: 'MyLibrary JS distribution'}, {path: 'dist/MyLibrary.css', label: 'MyLibrary CSS
distribution'}]`: include the `dist/MyLibrary.js` and `dist/MyLibrary.css` files, and label them `MyLibrary JS
distribution` and `MyLibrary CSS distribution` in the GitHub release.

`css` files in the `dist` directory and its sub-directories excluding the minified version, plus the
`build/MyLibrary.zip` file and label it `MyLibrary` in the GitHub release.

### Usage

The plugins are used by default by [Semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) so no
specific configuration is required if `githubUrl` and `githubApiPathPrefix` are set via environment variable.

Each individual plugin can be disabled, replaced or used with other plugins in the `package.json`:

```json
{
  "release": {
    "verifyConditions": ["@semantic-release/github", "@semantic-release/npm", "verify-other-condition"],
    "publish": ["@semantic-release/npm", "@semantic-release/github", "other-publish"],
    "success": ["@semantic-release/github", "other-success"],
    "fail": ["@semantic-release/github", "other-fail"]
  }
}
```

Options can be set within the plugin definition in the [**semantic-release** configuration](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/blob/caribou/docs/usage/configuration.md#configuration):

```json
{
  "release": {
    "verifyConditions": [
      "@semantic-release/npm",
      {
        "path": "@semantic-release/github",
        "githubUrl": "https://my-ghe.com",
        "githubApiPathPrefix": "/api-prefix"
      },
      "verify-other-condition"
    ],
    "publish": [
      "@semantic-release/npm",
      {
        "path": "@semantic-release/github",
        "githubUrl": "https://my-ghe.com",
        "githubApiPathPrefix": "/api-prefix",
        "assets": [
          {"path": "dist/asset.min.css", "label": "CSS distribution"},
          {"path": "dist/asset.min.js", "label": "JS distribution"}
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
